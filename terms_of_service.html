        <h1>Terms of Service for AnonWish</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6th of January, 2025.</p>
        <p>Welcome to AnonWish! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the AnonWish website and platform (the "Service"). By accessing or using AnonWish, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To access certain features of the Service, you can log in using Google OAuth. By logging in with your Google account, you agree to share your Google ID and email address with AnonWish for authentication purposes. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Google account credentials and ensuring that your account is used securely.</p>
        
        <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the Service in a manner that is respectful to others and in accordance with these Terms. You may not engage in any activity that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violates any laws or regulations</li>
            <li>Harasses or harms other users</li>
            <li>Exploits the Service in an unauthorized manner</li>
            <li>Impersonates other users or entities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Wishes and Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>AnonWish allows users to post wishes and fulfill others' wishes anonymously. While you can interact with the platform, all actions should remain respectful, kind, and within the boundaries of privacy. Any abuse of the system, such as fake wish fulfillment or dishonest actions, may result in penalties including loss of social credits or account suspension and bans.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Privacy and Data</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for detailed information on how we collect, use, and store your personal information. We use your Google ID and email for login purposes and to track your wishes and social credits.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Content Ownership</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of the wishes you post on AnonWish. However, by posting a wish, you grant AnonWish the right to display your content publicly on the platform and allow others to fulfill your wishes. We do not claim ownership over your content.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Termination of Account</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to certain features of the Service if you violate these Terms or engage in inappropriate behavior. As there is no traditional account creation process, we link your data to the email address provided via Google OAuth. If you'd like to disconnect your data from our platform or request removal of your data, please contact us.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>AnonWish is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of the Service, and you agree that AnonWish will not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the platform.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated version on this page. Your continued use of AnonWish after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us.</p>
